# orthello Game with both Two player mode and Computer player mode

  About the game it is clearly explained at http://dhconnelly.com/paip-python/docs/paip/othello.html and I implemented all the things mentioned in that website

  Compile the code using the command g++ game.C and execute the code using ./a.out(g++ has to be installed)

  The game which I coded displays 0,1,2 where 0 means no coin is present at that place, 1 means player1's coin is present at that place and 2 for player2's coin at that place
  
  please follow the output statements and play the game
  
  For placing coin you are requested to enter the co-ordinates where you want to place the coin. Rows and Columns are labelled from 0 to 7 as the game board is 8 x 8

  Enjoy playing Orthello:)
